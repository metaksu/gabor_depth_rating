This project was made for Dr. Mark Albert's Computational Neuroscience class

The project creates varying receptive fields and analyzes how manipulation of properties of these filters can affect depth perception.


V1 Cortical Cells in the Occipital Lobe each contain their own receptive field (a visual stimulus that stimulates said neuron).
Receptive fields vary greatly from one another and often serve for different computational functions.
In this case, we're looking at a receptive fields ability to detect depth and thus percieve it.
